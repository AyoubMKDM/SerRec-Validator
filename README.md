# WS-DREAM-utility
This package aims to help to work with  [WS-DREAM](http://wsdream.github.io/) datasets. After finding that the link provided on the official website is broken, and posting an issue on their repository but getting no answer. I wrote this small package in python 3 to help ease the work with the dataset, and hopefully, help other developers to start working directly and start manipulating the data. 

All credits are reserved for Zibin Zheng, Yilei Zhang, and Michael R. Lyu. the publishers of the dataset, if you work with this dataset please refer to one of the following papers: 
[Investigating QoS of Real-World Web Services](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260520057_Investigating_QoS_of_Real-World_Web_Services),
[Distributed QoS Evaluation for Real-World Web Services](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224168791_Distributed_QoS_Evaluation_for_Real-World_Web_Services)

## Technologies used:
